Script01: first file will read in the following data sets:
      referral, payment, acs
save them as .RData for future use    

Script02:  based on national referral network, 
american community survey provides the billing Zipcode for physicians
This is script will be used to generate a lot of small network at the HSA level

Generate -- using paprallel not save time. because copying file every time. 
NpiHsaHrr.RData -- each HSA, its network features
Network_Hrr.RData

Script03 - Script04, 
avoiding copy the big data file, I copy the code multiple times, 39 pieces on 39 terminals to create the 
table npi, hsa_id, hrr_id, for 10,000 npis each.
Combining the individual result, creat the whole matrix  with npi, hsa, hrr
NpiHsaHrr.RData -- npi, hsa_id, hrr_id
Network_Hsa.RData -- hsa-based networks, 
Network_Hrr.RData -- hrr_based networks.


Script05: calculate all the network features that we are interested in. 
save them into two .csv files -- "Net_Hsa_Features.csv"

Script06: calculate all the network features that we are interested in. 
save them into two .csv files -- "Net_Hrr_Features.csv

Script07: combine the totalPay, hsa variables, network features.
build a regression based on model selection, back/forward selection.
