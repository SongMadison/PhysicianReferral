This is schatch node showsing the big picture of what's going on with
our project.

### Response variable :

For a certain service, submit amount for each hospital

### The model to be considered :

submit amount for each hospital

= *β*<sub>1</sub> hopstal level features + *β*<sub>2</sub> HSA level
features + *β*<sub>3</sub> HSA-level network features.

### works to be done

1.  background ( why allowed amount is not good, what modeling submit
    amount is meaninful, solving what issues)

2.  Ruosi, we need to get a data set about Hopital level variables / HSA
    levels (could be fewer may 10 meaningful ones)

3.  I want to try something on network analysis -- particularly, to see
    whether the network strucure has changes from 2012 to 2014. I will
    build a set-up for the model, put these three types of variables. So
    that once we have the better, we just plug them in.
