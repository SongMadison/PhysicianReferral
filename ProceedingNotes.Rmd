This is schatch node showsing the big picture of what's going on with our project.


### Response variable : 
For a certain service,
submit amount for each hospital 

### The model to be considered :

submit amount for each hospital 

= $\beta_1$ hopstal level features + $\beta_2$ HSA level features + $\beta_3$ HSA-level network features.


### works to be done 

1) background ( why allowed amount is not good, what modeling submit amount is meaninful, solving what issues)

2) Ruosi, we need to get a data set about Hopital level variables / HSA levels (could be fewer may 10 meaningful ones)

3) I want to try something on network analysis -- particularly, to see whether the network strucure has changes from 2012 to 2014. 
   I will build a set-up for the model, put these three types of variables. So that once we have the better, we just plug them in.
